# 2D-Material-Powder-Electrode:
A repository containing the relevant info required to machine (or 3D print) and assemble a powder electrode using commonly available parts from McMaster Carr. The powder electrode once assembled is a versatile tool for the intercalation of layered materials to expedite exfoliation. If you have any questions or suggestions feel free to guide them to: ndwilson@uwaterloo.ca

**Powder Electrode Design Notes:**
Schematic of the Teflon powder electrode. The electrode is machined from one solid piece of one inch diameter Teflon bar. The only slight modification to this drawing would be that the M22x2 threads that hold the two pieces together cannot span the full 10 mm portion of the larger piece. To be possible to machine, a small amount of the threads must be turned off the bottom portion of that 10 mm span.

**Electrode Holder Design Notes:**
Schematic of the simple 3d Printed electrode holder. The holder was printed out of standard 1.75 mm polypropylene filament and made to fit a standard 50 mL beaker with a 40 mm diameter. The holder has a space where a powder electrode or crystal clip can be positioned as well as two smaller holes for the placement of the reference electrode and counter electrode.
